Your challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
    Receive validation errors if:
        Any field is empty when the form is submitted
        The day number is not between 1-31
        The month number is not between 1-12
        The date is in the future
        The date is invalid, e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
    Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

This challenge is designed to sharpen your JavaScript and form validation skills. Working with dates in JavaScript can be tricky, so this will be a nice test!

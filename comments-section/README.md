Your challenge is to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

Your users should be able to:

    Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
    Upvote and downvote comments
    View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    Bonus: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
    Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application
